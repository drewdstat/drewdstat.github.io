As this was my first major trek, I followed advice to do this, and I'm glad for the time I had chatting with the guide, but I also know that one could do this while carrying their own pack without too much difficulty. The side of the Apurimac Canyon you descend down after passing Capuliyoc is very dry with large yucca plants. You get down to a bridge at the bottom to go over the Apurimac River, and once on the other side, it's much more of a cloud rainforest with lusher vegetation and more insects. I camped the first night in my tent on a terrace at Marampata, which had a great view looking out into the canyon. The next day I explored Choquequirao all day with maybe 15-20 other people being there at the same time.

We saw for ourselves that there was a large bergschrund separating us from the summit block, and the snow was too soft to protect trying to get on there. We decided to give up and turn back, and by the time we started descending the snow, it was warm and slushy enough that we set up a snow anchor and the leader of our rope team belayed us down the first portion of the descent. Again it was intolerably hot on the glacier surface, and we made it back to camp to spend one more night before heading out. Highlights included seeing Olympus up close and passing a herd of elk near the Hoh River. Ultimately, it was a beautiful, remarkable trip, but we did fail to grab the exact summit.

I found it easier to spot the trail on the way back, but it did seem to disappear periodically. The unmaintained trail from Rocky Mountain down the valley is basically nonexistent. I spent a couple hours of frustrating bushwhacking as the sun set to get down to the river, where there is a fairly open trail on the southern bank of the East Branch Neversink River. However, this trail periodically disappears and often shifts side to side, so it was at times difficult to follow, particularly in the dark. There s one point where the trail is open and easy by the river, but then it terminates when a rocky bluff moves up flush against the river. I m not sure the typical move there, but I just went straight up the bluff and bushwhacked maybe 10ish minutes on top before seeing the trail again below and making my way back down to it. There are a few sections where multiple small rivers criss cross over the trail, and it becomes pretty tough to follow then. I m sure I caught at least a hundred spiders to my face from the bushwhacking. My takeaway was that in the Catskills, a maintained trail is just about as easy as a trail can be, but an unmaintained one is somewhere between frequently lost due to vegetation and blowdowns to nonexistent and a full on bushwhack.

There s a short stretch of scrambling that feels much harder going down than coming up and a somewhat steep incline hiking down to the col, and then it s pretty easy up to Blackhead. Not much of a view on that summit, but to the west of it is a view point facing Black Dome.",17610

Also, I went over to the marker for Broad Mountain along the forest road and past the power lines. There s no view there, but there s an excellent viewpoint of the oxbow bend in the river just past there to the north along an obvious trail. The marker for Broad Mountain is slightly off trail and in the woods.",
