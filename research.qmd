### About Me
I'm an epidemiologist and statistician formerly working in chemical safety and chronic disease research at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, and now looking for opportunities in pharmaceutical research and development. 

My primary experience is in both developing and applying statistical methods to investigate the determinants of chronic disease. I have training in Bayesian and frequentist statistics, machine learning, epidemiology, toxicology, immunology, bioinformatics (transcriptomics, scRNA, metabolomics, etc.), endocrinology, and neurology.

### Methods Development/Teaching
 - R package [wqspt](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wqspt/index.html): Using a novel permutation test method to improve the statistical properties of the weighted quantile sum regression, which determines the additive combined association of multiple exposures with a single outcome.
 - R package [ResidualKMeans](https://www.github.com/drewdstat/ResidualKMeans): Method for unsupervised clustering of mixed type continuous and categorical data while controlling for structure induced by a grouping variable such as cohort in a multi-cohort study.
 - R package [impgrplasso](https://www.github.com/drewdstat/impgrplasso): Combining methods involving a group LASSO penalty for multiply imputed data into one function to perform LASSO regression on data with missingness.
 - R package [DrewDayRFunctions](https://www.github.com/drewdstat/DrewDayRFunctions): Functions with relevance for epidemiologic analyses including functions to performing many regressions, nonlinear mediation, nonlinear regressions, and exploratory data analysis.
 - R teaching [Introduction to R](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/drewdstat/TeachingR/blob/main/vignettes/IntrotoR.html): Document to teach a student just starting with R to go from zero to developing useful functions and loops.

### Research Interests
 - Omics prediction of chronic disease: Using omics data to predict chronic disease patterns to discover shared mechanisms ([Placental gene transcription and child cognitive and behavioral outcomes (abstract)](https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/abs/10.1289/isee.2020.virtual.P-0298))
 - Multi-outcome health profiles: Using phenotypes of disease outcome co-occurrence to indentify risks and mechanisms shared between seemingly unrelated diseases ([Residual K-means paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412024000722)) (see also my experiments with autoencoders at [VAECM_Final](https://www.github.com/drewdstat/VAECM_Final))
 - Mixture exposures: Advancing mixture exposure modelling to understand the combined health impact of common environmental factors ([Weighted Quantile Sum regression with Permutation Test (WQSPT) methods paper](https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/EHP10570))
 - Environmental Epidemiology: exploring associations between chemical and other stressor exposures and later life chronic disease:
